## Python Project :
As a data enthusiast, "I am driven by the curiosity to uncover patterns and trends within placement data. Exploring the consecutive years of 2022-23 provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolving dynamics of student placements. Through this project, I aim to extract meaningful insights that not only contribute to informed decision-making but also empower stakeholders with a deeper understanding of the factors influencing placement outcomes.I tried to make the program interactive so that user can get the graph as per his or her convienient" 

### The main file is project.py(year 2023) and placement.py(year 2022)
placement.py : it doesnt uses any external file as package all the functions are mentioned in the same file.
<br>
project.py : it uses two external file module.py and compensation.py where all the functions are written and they are accessed through main block of file.

NOTE : All the csv and xlsx are also updated on the repository so that one can successfully run all the programs needed
